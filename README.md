# unity-boilerplate
A simple boilerplate to start my Unity Projects. :rocket:

What's included?
* The gitignore file for Unity and Visual Studio
* A (currently pretty empty) Preloader Scene

What should be included on the next versions?
* A singleton Game Manager
* Behaviours for Moving a GameObject, Camera Follow, etc.
